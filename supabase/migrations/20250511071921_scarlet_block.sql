  # Fix RLS policies for bookings table

  1. Changes
    - Simplify RLS policies to allow both anonymous and authenticated bookings
    - Remove unnecessary conditions that were causing policy violations
    - Make property size optional

  2. Security
    - Maintain RLS but with clearer, more permissive policies for bookings
    - Allow anonymous submissions while still protecting data
